Once upon a time
================

Jack and Morten
---------------

Once upon a time, not far from here, there was a young Farm Boy, called Jack.

His parents were elderly and sick. He had no brothers or sisters nor cousins nor aunts or uncles.

And the land they lived on was very poor.

This boy Jack had a plough horse, and every day he would take Morten (that was his name)
to try to work a bit of good, whether it was clearing a ditch, or turning over some sod, or fixing a wall.

Now Morten was a stout horse and very obedient, but he was past his prime.

Ageing too was the kit that Jack had.
The bridles were mouldy, and the harrows were rusty, and the buckets came apart in your hand.

Also the ground, which was a horrible smash of stone and clay, must have had some curse upon it.
It bent the plough, it clogged the bridges, it pulled every shoe from poor Morten's spongy old feet.

The Blacksmith
--------------

And so it was that Jack was a regular visitor to the local Blacksmith.

And one day, when Morten had shed a shoe, and Jack couldn't see where it had fallen,
he led his horse onto the narrow track and over to the Forge.

Now the Blacksmith had a daughter, who was very pretty, and Jack's age. Her name was Blathnaid.

We aren't going to hear much about Blathnaid just now though, because the Blacksmith keeps her hidden
whenever Jack shows up. He worries that Blathnaid, who sketches pictures of young men with their horses,
might be thinking of Jack more often than is good for her.

He has hopes she will marry into money, and doesn't want her going off with
some young villain who can't pay his bills.

The Journey
-----------

Three challenges, rain, rats and ...
Tea from the Trivet fixes.

The City
--------

Has to give up Morten to get in.
"Don't worry Jack, he'll eat better than you will", they laugh.
Later sees fragments of blanket when he's clearing up at the tavern.

The Friend
----------

Trivet is a Guild sign and is everywhere. Jack tries to spot all three Ss, but without result.
Finally, the friend approaches him; he's seen Jack use the Trivet.

Kroll
-----

The name of that spirit is Krol.

I am not the world expert on Krol.
What I have heard about him would fill a book, although not all of that can have been the truth.

I know he'd been an important figure in Antiquity. And he wore flesh again in our modern age,
and performed many brave deeds here.

But at the time of this story he was held back in the Netherworld. For reasons I don't understand,
his spirit was bound to the Town Square, and the best he could manage was to manifest in the cellar
of that Tavern, when the moon was full enough to shine through the bars of the window.

The Return
----------

Bats are released.
Two graves, an apple tree and an Oak tree.

Retribution, to retrain an injury, relentlesly hunts the wicked.
