Once upon a time
================

Jack and Morten
---------------

Once upon a time, not far from here, there was a young Farm Boy, called Jack.

His parents were elderly and sick. He had no brothers or sisters nor cousins nor aunts or uncles.

And the land they lived on was very poor.

This boy Jack had a plough horse, and every day he would take Morten (that was his name)
to try to work a bit of good, whether it was clearing a ditch, or turning over some sod, or fixing a wall.

Now Morten was a stout horse and very obedient, but he was past his prime.

Ageing too was the kit that Jack had.
The bridles were mouldy, and the harrows were rusty, and the buckets came apart in your hand.

The Blacksmith
--------------

Now the ground, which was a horrible smash of stone and clay, must have had some curse upon it.
It bent the plough, it clogged the bridges, it pulled every shoe from poor Morten's spongy old feet.

So Jack was no stranger to the local Blacksmith.

Let me tell you now about the Blacksmith.

Kroll
-----

The name of that spirit is Krol.

I am not the world expert on Krol.
What I have heard about him would fill a book, although not all of that could have been the truth.

I know he'd been an important figure in Antiquity. And he wore flesh again in our modern age,
and performed many brave deeds here.

But at the time of this story he was held back in the Netherworld. For reasons I don't understand,
his spirit was bound to the Town Square, and the best he could manage was to manifest in the cellar
of that Tavern, when the moon was full enough to shine through the bars of the window.
