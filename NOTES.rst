Once upon a time
================

Jack and Morten
---------------

Once upon a time, not far from here, there was a young Farm Boy, called Jack.

His parents were elderly and sick. He had no brothers or sisters nor cousins nor aunts or uncles.

And the land they lived on was very poor.

This boy Jack had a plough horse, and every day he would take Morten (that was his name)
to try to work a bit of good, whether it was clearing a ditch, or turning over some sod, or fixing a wall.

Now Morten was a stout horse and very obedient, but he was past his prime.

Ageing too was the kit that Jack had.
The bridles were mouldy, and the harrows were rusty, and the buckets came apart in your hand.

Also the ground, which was a horrible smash of stone and clay, must have had some curse upon it.
It bent the plough, it clogged the bridges, it pulled every shoe from poor Morten's spongy old feet.

The Blacksmith
--------------

And so it was that Jack was a regular visitor to the local Blacksmith.

And one day, when Morten had shed a shoe, and Jack couldn't see where it had fallen,
he led his horse onto the narrow track and over to the Forge.

Now the Blacksmith had a daughter, who was very pretty, and Jack's age. Her name was Blathnaid.

We aren't going to hear much about Blathnaid just now though, because the Blacksmith keeps her hidden
whenever Jack shows up. He worries that Blathnaid, who sketches pictures of young men with their horses,
might be thinking of Jack more often than is good for her.

He has hopes she will marry into money, and doesn't want her going off with
some young villain who can't pay his bills.

Shoes
-----

The front part of the forge, where the anvil often is, was open on three sides.
There stood the Blacksmith, warming against the furnace. He had been watching Jack approach up the path,
and could tell from Morten's stepping what the matter was about.

He took the end of rope from Jack's hand and steadied Morten for a moment.
Then led him to a rail where he could check his hooves.

The forge
---------

Jack knew he had no way to pay the Blacksmith, so he found it difficult to stand and watch him work.
Instead he wandered across to the other end of the forge, where he was out of sight for a while.

Up above, the roof was supported by a sturdy iron frame, from which a chain hoist dangled. From the dark
corners of the eves, Jack could hear rustling and squeaking.

In the middle of the room was the bottom half of a great casting mold.
And here was all sorts of clutter piled up waiting for the next smelting; bags of bent and flaking nails,
broken hasps and gears and levers. All damp and coated in bat droppings and bloom.

A token
-------

The Blacksmith opened a small tin box, taking from it a wrap of waxed paper and a metal tool, like a saddler's punch.

Then he heated a small billet of iron, about the size of a finger, which had a hole in one end.
Peeling apart the paper, despite his grimy fingers, he carefully removed a small thin sheet of white metal foil.
With the iron still hot, he deftly dropped the metal foil upon the surface, and placing the punch on top, struck
it smartly with a hammer.

After it had cooled, the Blacksmith slipped a leather cord through the hole and placed it around the boy's neck.
Jack saw that within the metal was now a circular seal of an intricate design, which by some strange
chemistry glowed green.

This will let you into the City.
It will cease to shine by the time the moon has waned. You will need to be out by then.

The Journey
-----------

Three challenges, rain, rats and ...
Tea from the Trivet fixes.

The City
--------

Has to give up Morten to get in.
"Don't worry Jack, he'll eat better than you will", they laugh.
Later sees fragments of blanket when he's clearing up at the tavern.

The Friend
----------

Trivet is a Guild sign and is everywhere. Jack tries to spot all three Ss, but without result.
Finally, the friend approaches him; he's seen Jack use the Trivet.

Weave
-----

Sensitivity             Simplicity          Spontaneity
            Cognition              Courage             Compassion

Kroll
-----

The name of that spirit is Krol.

I am not the world expert on Krol.
What I have heard about him would fill a book, although not all of that can have been the truth.

I know he'd been an important figure in Antiquity. And he wore flesh again in our modern age,
and performed many brave deeds here.

But at the time of this story he was held back in the Netherworld. For reasons I don't understand,
his spirit was bound to the Town Square, and the best he could manage was to manifest in the cellar
of that Tavern, when the moon was full enough to shine through the bars of the window.

Payback
-------

All at once there was a strange shift in the structure of the Smithy. From the space in the roof poured out
in their hundreds a thick swarm of bats. In a flurry of fur and leather they ascended in a column like the smoke of a
wet chimney.

As they beat their wings, they raised an evil cloud of dust and metal. This haze rose up until the sun itself burned white and angry like a
miner's match.

Then all together they turned and headed north towards the City.

The Return
----------

Two graves, an apple tree and an Oak tree.

Sayings
-------

Raro antecedentem scelestum deseruit pede poena claudo. (Horace)
Retribution, to retrain an injury, relentlesly hunts the wicked.

fides qua creditur numquam falletur
Full faith that is never broken
Sic semper corruptionis
