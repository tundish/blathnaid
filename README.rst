Bláthnaid
:::::::::

This project is an experiment in interactive fiction.

It combines the technologies of Web and Print,
Natural language, structured Markup, and computational Code.

It begins with a book_.

The Book
========

The text of the book is held in this repository.
It was written in a restructuredText_ format.

The source text has been processed with a `Python script`_ and typeset to PDF.
The book went to print in August 2022.

Right now, only a small number of copies are in circulation. They pass from hand to hand.

What's Next?
============

Once you adopt Web technologies, all sorts of things become possible.
With the book_ as a starting point, you could easily imagine:

* A fully orchestrated soundtrack which plays along as you read.
* A map of the story world which you can explore to discover hidden extras.
* A way for the reader to affect the story, leading to multiple endings.
* The dialogue as a screenplay, and the story as a movie.

All of these are now possible. Which shall we try first?

If you haven't already, please `sign up`_ to the GitHub platform.
Then you can bring a new issue_ against the code.

You can suggest ideas, complain about mistakes, offer advice, and indicate opportunities.
Or, just say hello and tell me what you thought about 'Bláthnaid'.
