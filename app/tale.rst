Once upon a time
================

.. Bláthnaid is a name from the Gaeilge tradition. In England we would say 'Blawnid'.

Jack and Morten
---------------

Once upon a time, not far from here, there was a young Farm Boy, called Jack.

His parents were elderly and sick. He had no brothers or sisters nor cousins nor aunts or uncles.

And the land they lived on was very poor.

This boy Jack had a plough horse, and every day he would take Morten (that was his name)
to try to work a bit of good, whether it was clearing a ditch, or turning over some dirt, or mending a wall.

Now Morten was a stout horse and very obedient, but he was past his prime.

Ageing too was the kit that Jack had.
The bridles were mouldy, and the harrows were rusty, and the buckets came apart in your hand.

Also the ground, which was a horrible stodge of stone and clay, must have had some curse upon it.
It bent the plough, it clogged the bridges, it pulled every shoe from poor Morten's spongy old feet.

The Blacksmith
--------------

And so it was that Jack was a regular visitor to the local Blacksmith.

And one day, when Morten had shed a shoe, and Jack couldn't see where it had fallen,
he led his horse onto the narrow track and over to the Forge.

Now the Blacksmith had a daughter, who was very pretty, and Jack's age. Her name was Bláthnaid.

We aren't going to hear much about Bláthnaid just now though, because the Blacksmith keeps her hidden
whenever Jack shows up. He worries that Bláthnaid, who sketches pictures of young men with their horses,
might be thinking of Jack more often than is good for her.

He has hopes she will marry into money, and doesn't want her going off with
some young villain who can't pay his bills.

Open for business
-----------------

The front part of the forge, where the anvil often is, was open on three sides.
There stood the Blacksmith, warming against the furnace. He had been watching Jack approach up the path,
and could tell from Morten's stepping what the matter was about.

He took the end of rope from Jack's hand and steadied Morten for a moment.
Then he led the horse to a rail where he tied him up next to a butt of water.

Shoes
-----

I should tell you a little more about the Blacksmith, but I don't want to hold up the rest of the story.
I'll just say that he was a very wise man. He spoke easily with people, and he listened carefully to animals.
He wasn't only a skilled Blacksmith, but also a clever Armourer, and a reliable Farrier.

He hated to see people sick, or animals hurt. And so without a word he began to check on Morten; his eyes,
his teeth, his belly. And then to his hooves, whereupon he groaned quietly on seeing the state of each of them.

The forge
---------

Jack knew he had no way to pay the Blacksmith, so he found it difficult to stand and watch him work.
Instead he wandered across to the other end of the forge, where he was out of sight for a while.

Up above, the roof was supported by a sturdy iron frame, from which a chain hoist dangled. From the dark
corners of the eves, Jack could hear rustling and squeaking.

In the middle of the workshop was the bottom half of a great casting mold.
And here was all sorts of clutter piled up waiting for the next smelting; bags of bent and flaking nails,
broken hasps and gears and levers. All damp and coated in bat droppings and bloom.

Send me the Bill
----------------

Finally, when the horse was fully shod, the Blacksmith ducked back into where Jack had been standing.
"All's done", said the smith, standing fully in the doorway.

"Dad thanks you", said Jack without much conviction.

"That's certain, Jack. And we must reckon up, presently. For today and for times past."

Broke
-----

In those days you see, people would always help their neighbours whenever there was need. And should they get to
owing they would settle up at Yuletide. Jack blushed to think that this year there had been very little to offer anyone.
And the Blacksmith was chief among their creditors. According to custom, Jack bowed and asked how he might
be of service.

Errand
------

"I do have an errand for you", says the Blacksmith. "There is a message to deliver. It will be some days travel."

Packing
-------

So Jack went home, and hunted around the little cottage for whatever might be useful on a journey.
He found so little food in the place that he dared not take any, for fear of leaving his parents in
want while he was away.

He picked out a woollen blanket to sleep in, which he laid out before the fire so the damp would drive away.
He found a leather bottle, which he warmed up and replenished with wax.
He had some kindling, a blade, a flint, and a can with a lid so he could boil up water.

Morten would have to forage. And Jack would go hungry. But he was not dismayed.
He fell asleep before the grate, happy for the first time in months.

Reporting for Duty
------------------

In the morning he would fill it with water from the stream behind the house.

The Trivet
----------

The Blacksmith reached under the bench and pulled out a chunk of iron, round in shape, and about the size of his hand.
He looked at it thoughtfully for a moment, before taking a rough brush to scrub away the rust.

It was a trivet, such as you'd use to balance a kettle above a fire. This one was solidly made, but in a decorative
design; it had curved spokes like the wheel of some fantastic chariot. Around the circumference were embossed letters,
not yet clear enough to read.

A token
-------

The Blacksmith opened a small tin box, taking from it a wrap of waxed paper and a metal tool, like a saddler's punch.

Then he heated a small billet of iron, about the size of a pea pod, which had a hole in one end.
Peeling apart the paper, despite his grimy fingers, he carefully removed a small thin sheet of white metal foil.
With the iron still hot, he deftly dropped the metal foil upon the surface, and placing the punch on top, struck
it smartly with a hammer.

After it had cooled, the Blacksmith slipped a leather cord through the hole and placed it around the boy's neck.
Jack saw that within the metal was now a circular seal of an intricate design, which by some strange
chemistry glowed green.

The Mission
-----------

The Blacksmith led Jack away from the building and on to the open road. "Jack, you are to go to the City", he said.
"Follow the road East. The charm I have given you will allow you in. But listen; the rise of the New Moon will
stop it shining. After that it is useless."

"When you get inside, seek out the Master of the Guild of Smiths. The guild sign looks very like this trivet you carry.
He will know who sends you by the charm around your neck."

"Tell him this; that Bláthnaid is of age to marry. And now you must go."

They set off
------------

So Jack set off. The first few miles east were familiar to him, passing through places he had been before.
At the little hamlets on the way, he would look to catch the eye of anyone around, and wave and bid them good day.
He felt very proud and important to be on an errand to the City.

As the miles rolled on, and the day grew late, he started to notice a change in the country. The hedges were less
well kept than before. The ditches were choked and the signposts and milestones overgrown with weed.

In the evening he spied ahead a group of tents and carts. He guessed this would be tinkers, who move about
wherever there is work. When he was younger they'd occasionally passed by, and his Mother had brought out the old tin bath
for them to mend.

The encampment was at the side of the road, and several people were tending fires or smoking pipes or feeding donkeys.
Jack greeted them every one, and some replied and some did not. They did not seem to be tinkers at all. There were many
children, and some old folk. And they were not very organised, and they all looked tired, and cold, and hungry.

Of course, Jack had no food, and none was offered to him. So he built a little fire away from the main group, and
set up the trivet, and boiled some water.

Now this trivet was very special; only a few Blacksmiths know how to make such a thing.
Because whatever you brewed upon it, however little tea you had; in fact, no matter if you were only boiling hay,
that brew would nourish and cheer you throughout, and you would not feel the lack of a meal.

So Jack rolled himself up in his blanket, near to the fire, all warm and comfy.
Morten settled down under a tree, happy to be away from the plough, and very pleased with his new shoes.

Towards the City
----------------

They awoke in the grey of early dawn, and were soon on their way again.
As they they went on, the road east got broader.
The Villages they passed through were more frequent. The bigger they got, the more shabby they seemed to be.
The countryside around was ever more sad and bare, with less and less forage for Morten.

And so for three more days they travelled. Jack could tell Morten was getting tired, and tried not to ride him, but led
him for miles at a time by the bridle. He would pat the horse's flank, and worry about how skinny his ribs were becoming.

Jack had ceased to greet other travellers on the road, and preferred very much to camp alone. As he lay looking up
at the stars, he would take out the locket the Blacksmith had made for him, and marvel at how it glowed in the darkness.
The New Moon was yet two weeks away. Plenty of time to deliver a message, thought Jack. And as he looked east he spied
another glow. The bonfires and braziers of the City were only a few hours away now.

The City
--------

The last few miles were grim. There was not a tree or bush to be seen now; only a blasted and boggy heath. The road was
lined on both sides by ragged camps; turves piled up for walls, rooved with the wreckage of tattered wagons.
And everywhere, the sounds and smells of sad and hungry people.

The road was controlled by troops, who barred the way to the City and only opened the barricades at certain times of day.

In his whole life, Jack had never stood in a line for anything, and the longer he waited the less sure of himself he
became. Finally, at the barrier, whereupon a sourfaced man in a leather tunic demanded to know what was his business,
Jack could only hold up the locket and say, "I carry a message". That seemed to suffice; the guard lifted his truncheon
and waved him through.

The walls of the City lay before them, and the road led up to an enormous gate. There was another line here. Scores of carts
stood by, piled up with all kinds of goods. There were angry voices as traders argued with guards and revenue men. Jack went on
past. He gathered his few belongings from Morten's back, and hoisted them on his own. Then he aimed for a smaller door next
to the main entry which seemed to be open to those on foot.

The smaller gate was flanked by two guards, sternly on duty. They held short, solid bills with evil-looking hooks at the end.
One of the men stepped forward to take Morten's bridle. The other offered the point of his weapon and advised Jack he should
explain himself or go back where he came.

Jack repeated the words that had got him past the previous challenge. This time, the guard studied the locket
carefully, before finally nodding. Then he asked, in a mocking way, whether the horse carried a message too, and where
was his token for entry?

The first guard tied poor Morten to a gatepost, saying, "if you can't feed him, you shouldn't keep him".
The second man joked, "sure, he'll eat very well presently!" There was nothing that Jack could do but step through the
gate while he was able, to the laughter of the guards as he passed.

Inside
------

Inside the wall, Jack found himself on a raised buttress, with stone battlements on either side. Two flights of steps led
down to the street below. He tripped and tumbled down them, so upset was he at the loss of Morten. In the street,
several fellows who were gathered there took notice of him and Jack realised he had better recover his wits or else be
robbed again. He hurried ahead until he got to a spot where he could not be surprised. There he sank to his
haunches, steadied his breathing, and began to look around.

Environment
-----------

Jack feared two things. First was to be robbed, which seemed to be not merely a common occurrence, but the very
commerce of half the city. The second concern was getting lost, and while looking lost, then to be cornered in some
alley by thieves.

As for losing his way he had scant chance, since only a few main streets of the city were open to all. Every neighbourhood,
where families were established, had set up gates and pickets, protecting their own, and permitting only
their own to pass through.

Exploring
---------

.. fixme::
.. todo:: explain locations

So Jack was able to trapse only a quarter of a mile back and forth, and quickly learned his way about the place. Mostly
the streets were well cobbled, and the buildings both old and new, were in use by someone for something.

This main district was shared by all sorts. And to a large extent there was order.
The beggars were at begging, the guards were loafing about, the hawkers were ringing their bells, the merchants were
showing off their wares. The bankers were busy dodging everyone; most especially each other.

.. todo:: street life, guards

.. todo:: mayoral proclamations

Scarcity
--------

Jack's first priority was to make contact with the Guild of Smiths, and he started by looking everywhere for their symbol.
Instead what he found all around him were notices. Mostly they forbade you from doing things.
"No fires or braziers by order" was regularly posted on walls around the city, and in the name of Mayor Ingomer.

Ingomer controlled the supply of food into the city. It was in his name that the guards stopped the wagons at the gate.
They diverted the best goods to his favoured merchants, and shook down the hauliers for revenue.

The mayor also had a system of licenses which meant you had to pay a fee for lighting fires.
So finding the Guild of Smiths was simple enough; they all worked together in an area near the docks, having had to
club together to get enough money to pay for the privilege of heating their forges.

A refuge
--------

Every building in the main thoroughfare, and at the dock next to the river, was barred and locked and secured against
strangers.

Jack found himself watching as two dreymen brought in barrels to the cellar. And he saw that every time one half of
those big cellar doors banged shut, the hasp on it shook a little loose.
Now when the dreymen left, they were careful to place a padlock on the door. But they couldn't seem to fasten it
properly, and after a minute or two, they gave up and left it dangling.

So Jack waited until there was some commotion further up the street, and all heads were turned. Then went over to
the doors and was able to work one bolt out of its seat, lift up one half of the hatchway, and slip inside.

The cellar
----------

Down below it was not fully dark. Some light streamed in by gratings which gave sight of the street above.
Jack saw the cellar was lined and vaulted in brick. It was all one room about ten feet high which got lower and darker towards
the back.

But he saw that as you went further inside, it got dusty, which made him think no one troubled to go there. And by
hopping over the floor into the shadows, he found a spot where he was sure he could sleep without being seen, even if
someone came in for some reason.

Now down in the cellar were many barrels all stacked up. But three stood separately on their side, and they were enormous.
Each with a tap, and a dish below to catch the drips.
And on the first barrel was painted "This", and on the second "That", and on the last one, "The Other".

They stood near some steps which quickly ended in a locked door, and nothing Jack could do could open that.
But he went to work on the main cellar hatch, and contrived with his knife to make sure that the bolt would allow him in and
out, notwithstanding any padlock above.

Refuge
------

.. TODO::

During the day, this part of town is OK because of guards. After curfew, very rough. Needs to survive his first night.

The Friend
----------

The Smiths for the most part got along with each other, and they never minded Jack making a brew on some embers with
his trivet. There were plenty of scraps of bark around the place, and Jack used that.

One of them, a man named Fell, took an interest in the trivet. He fancied he knew who might have made it. So he asked
Jack if he might take a closer look. But Jack was reluctant; all the time in the City he feared being robbed or tricked some how.

So Fell said, "My guess is there is a motto around the edge of that gadget you have. Do you know what is?"
Jack did not, but he held up the trivet in both hands for the Smith to see. "Courage", says the Smith. That is what
those markings mean". But Jack dared not risk any more loss, and he hid the trivet again in his bundle.


Weave
-----

Sensitivity             Simplicity          Spontaneity
            Cognition              Courage             Compassion

Fell
----

And Fell told him of the old days, when Smiths had such skill it would be thought magic today.

And how Ingomer, brother-in-law to the General of the Guards, on becoming Mayor, was the cause of the new rules.

First he created a licence for making locks, which the Smiths had to purchase from him at great cost.
Meanwhile, with the proceeds Ingomer was setting up his own Guild of Locksmiths, to whom he granted
the right in perpetuity a year later.

Then, after some strange accident which no one could explain, Ingomer instituted an inspectorate
for pressure vessels, whose eyewatering fees nearly put the Smiths out of business entirely.
Luckily, the new Guild of Boilermakers, of which Ingomer was Director, was soon in place to take on
the burden of both manufacture and assurance of all such things in the City.

Recently he'd forbidden the Smiths from making blades or any edged tools, and arranged for his
Guild of Cutlers to be licensed exclusively for those operations. Their factories were in a protected area near the Armoury.

And now finally, in a very suspiciously conducted election, Ingomer had himself become Master of the Guild of Smiths,
a postion which hitherto had been attained only by the most skilled and respected of craftsmen.


Krol
----

The name of that spirit is Krol.

I am not the world expert on Krol.
What I have heard about him would fill a book, although not all of that can have been the truth.

I do know he'd been an important figure in antiquity. And he did take shape again in our modern age,
and performed many brave deeds here.

But at the time of this story he was held back in the Netherworld. For reasons I don't understand,
his spirit was bound to the City, and the best he could manage was to manifest in the cellar
of that tavern, when the moon was full enough to shine through the bars of the windows.

Only when Gibbous. That leaves 7 nights of waning crescent before New Moon.

T 1
---

So Krol said, "I am cursed to be here while there is light from the moon. And I may eat only what is offered to me".
Jack thought about this for a moment and went over to one of the big barrels, which was called 'This'.
He opened up the tap a little, so it half-filled the tundish below.
And he passed it to the little Imp, who grinned and straight away started drinking it down.

S 1
---

Then Krol caught sight of Jack's trivet and thoughtfully traced the shape of one spoke with a thin bony finger.
"Do you know what this one is?", he asked.

Jack didn't have a clue what he was talking about.

"This spoke stands for Sensitivity", said Krol. He continued, sounding slightly tipsy.
"Sensitivity. Try to train that. It can be cultivated, can sensitivity ."
Jack was about to ask him to repeat himself, but when he looked he saw that Krol had fallen immediately to sleep.

T 2
---

And up popped Krol. Jack was pleased to see him, and went over to the second barrel, upon which was painted
'That'. He opened the tap until the tundish was half to the brim and he passed it across to his friend.

S 2
---

Krol needed no second invitation, and drank the beer gratefully. Then he set the dish down again, and went back to
the trivet, which was there on the floor. And he indicated one of the spokes and said, "Do you know what this one is?",
and of course Jack did not. "This one stands for Simplicity", said Krol.
He paused for a moment, trying not to stumble over his words.
"Simplicity. Try to train that. It can be cultivated, can simplicity."

And before Jack could get him to explain any more, Krol had curled up and was off to sleep.

T 3
---

And there was Krol again, but looking unhappy this evening. Straight away he said to Jack, "Tomorrow comes a crescent moon.
And so all my time is done."

And Jack looked down at his locket which was beginning to fade, and he knew that he had only seven days to carry out his
task in the City. And so he went over to The Other, and poured out a draft into the dish. Krol took it, and nodded his
thanks before knocking it back.

S 3
---

Krol reached out for the trivet, and he held it up into a faint pool of moonlight so Jack could see. He laid his
finger on the third spoke, and said, "This is Spontaneity."
He raised his finger in the air dramatically, and wagged it at Jack.
"Try to train that. It can be cultivated, can spontaneity."

There was a clatter as the trivet fell to the floor and rolled back against Jack's foot. Krol had fallen asleep.

Standing
--------

During the night, the inner door of the cellar would frequently open and someone from the tavern above would come down
to fetch a cask back upstairs. Jack never saw who it was because he took care always to be far back in the shadows.

He had also to remember not to leave tracks in the dust or to tear down any cobwebs lest he be discovered. So when he
was not rolled up in his blanket he was standing motionless, sometimes for hours.

Now this can be a very good thing to do, although not many people know the secret.


The Temple
----------

It used to be that rich merchants would introduce their daughters to court, in the hope that they would marry into
the nobility. Likewise the artisans would raise their girls with their sights on a son of a merchant. It was a
good system, because over time there grew alliances which served very much to secure a stable society.
The families relied on their seniors to make the connections, and so it had become the tradition to announce
one's offspring to the head of one's guild, and they would go and make enquiries as to a suitable match.

Ingomer
-------

And there before him stood Ingomer, in all his Mayoral finery, and surrounded by guards.
He looked older than the portrait on the notices, and altogether less noble.
Jack stepped forward and raised up his locket saying, "I carry a message!"

.. todo:: Ingomer foresees his doom.

Kicked out
----------

Some guards rushed forward to grab Jack, and two of them pushed through the crowd in advance of their captive.
They carried him as far as the next street corner, threw him down, and cursed him.

But Jack wasn't badly beaten, nor did the Guards arrest him.
They took him for one of Ingomer's spies, no doubt out of favour for having delivered bad news.

Escape
------

But the locket shone no longer.


The Journey home
----------------

And he taught them Cognition; how to figure things out. How to be sensitive to the Universe in all its music
and how to perceive the simple processes at play.

And so they began to organise themselves again.

Payback
-------

All at once there was a strange shift in the structure of the Smithy. From the space in the roof poured out
in their hundreds a thick swarm of bats. In a flurry of fur and leather they ascended in a column like the smoke of a
wet chimney.

As they beat their wings, they raised an evil cloud of dust and metal.
This haze rose up until the sun itself burned white and fierce like a gas mantle.

Then all together they turned and headed east towards the City.

The End
-------

Ingomer starts hitting the Gin.

Ideas
-----

* Smiths in the city have been forbidden from making knives, locks, or pressure vessels.
* New guilds of Cutlers. Locksmiths. Boilermakers.
* Only guards and smiths allowed fires
* The bats eavesdrop (listen)

... on how the Boilermakers were so proud of the prooving of their seams, but they had no care at all that the flux leeched into the Gin.
... or how the Locksmiths made sure there was not one key in the City would match another, yet the tumblers of their padlocks jammed up if you dropped them.
... And that the Cutlers were all blade and no tang, to the point that the Guards, after having been given new glaives, preferred to beat people with the handle, as it was safer for all concerned.
