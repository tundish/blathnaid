Moody
-----

.. FIXME::

As Jack was taking a safe line across the street, he became aware of someone who seemed not to be
going anywhere in particular, athough he was moving after a fashion. Moving so as not to get anywhere.
Walking all the time like a man crossing a wobbly bridge. But then having reached the end,
turning round and coming back again.

Jack tried to avoid the fellow, but could not; the skill of the man was to attach himself to others
and stick along like a lonely puppy.

First impressions of Moody
--------------------------

"Hey mate, are you hungry?", said the stranger, two or three times without waiting for an answer.
Jack looked boldly into the cowl and two green eyes looked back at him. Green eyes beneath
a long fringe of straw-coloured hair. The two lads stood at the same height, contemplating each other for a moment.
They might have been brothers. Twins even, save that Jack's suntanned face was several shades darker than
the pale, sickly aspect of the other.

Jack looked down to see that the stranger had pressed into his hand a black pillule, ugly like a rotten tooth.
"That'll take your mind off it.", said he. "Lasts all day, lasts all day."

Jack tried to give it back. "I don't want it", he said. "Anyway, I haven't any money".
The stranger looked shocked at this breach of protocol. "I'll make you a gift, then!", he proclaimed.
"You come back and see me when you do have some money. I'm Moody. Ask around for Moody."

And with that he suddenly span on his heel, and in one movement attached himself to another in the street,
a skinny man who had tried to cross over to avoid him, and had not crossed fast enough.

First meeting Aenaena
---------------------

Something out of the corner of Jack's eye made him pause mid-step. He turned his head to see more.
Ten yards away a young woman with copper red hair was looking straight at him. She was seated in the back
of a sort of cabin, with casements so wide and high it seemed to be all windows and hardly any wall.

"Hello", she said. "Come on over."
Jack was all confusion, but he went up to the open door.

The thing was newly built of wood, but attached to the very old dwelling behind it. It was freshly painted,
and nicely decorated with ribbons and ornaments. There was an urn on the floor from which a light
smoke arose. Woody and spicy, a fragrance so beguiling it seemed absolutely happy and right to
loosen one's boots and undo the buttons of any shirt one might be wearing.

The girl was young, maybe not yet Jack's age. She had on a pretty bodice, which showed a great deal
of her shoulders.

"I'm Aenaena", said she. And indeed, the ribbons hanging from
the walls bore that very name. "Sit here and keep me company. I don't have anyone to talk to."

There was a chair next to her so Jack dropped his belongings inside the door and sat awkwardly down.
He was at once terrified and fascinated. He tried very hard not to glance down, where a slit in
Aenaena's skirt showed a beautiful smooth white thigh.

Aenaena

.. TODO::

She used to work in the Temple but has her own modelling business now. Also does private shows.
In her spare time she draws pictures of the clients who haven't paid her. Pins them up outside to shame them.
Jack recognises one of them?

Reference only fans, clothing try-ons.

Ideas
-----

* Smiths in the city have been forbidden from making knives, locks, or pressure vessels.
* New guilds of Cutlers. Locksmiths. Boilermakers.
* Only guards and smiths allowed fires
* The bats eavesdrop (listen)

... on how the Boilermakers were so proud of the prooving of their seams, but they did not care if the flux leeched into the Gin.
... or how the Locksmiths made sure there was not one key in the City would match another, yet their tumblers seize up in the rain.
... And that the Cutlers were all blade and no tang, to the point that the Guards, after having been given new glaives, preferred to beat people with the handle, as it was safer for all concerned.
