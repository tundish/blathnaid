Bláthnaid
=========

Verse
-----

The door ajar,
In chalk and char
She lines the roads that journey far.

With shadow smears,
And lonesome tears
She shapes a paste of night-time fears.

All walled around,
And hunted down,
No mount, her hero she picks out.

And Bláthnaid,
Daily, works on he
Who as she draws, he dreams of she.
