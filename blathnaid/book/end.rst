[NARRATOR]_

    * The door ajar,
    * In chalk and char
    * She lines the roads that journey far.

[NARRATOR]_

    * With loving tears,
    * And shadow smears
    * A paste she shapes of nightly fears.

[NARRATOR]_

    * All walled around,
    * And hunted down
    * Her mounted hero she decks out.

[NARRATOR]_

    * And Bláthnaid,
    * Daily, works on he
    * Who as she draws, he dreams of she.
