*The characters in this story are fictitious, notwithstanding
the names they are given.
There is a question as to how real is the Author. It seems he has
drawn on current events for his inspiration, instead of making it
all up like a proper writer would.*

*The stuff about magic and meditation is established scientific fact.*
