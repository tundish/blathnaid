*The characters in this story are fictitious, notwithstanding
the names they have been given.
There is a question as to how real the Author is. We think he has
drawn on current events for his inspiration, instead of making it
all up like a proper writer would.*

*The stuff about magic and meditation is now established scientific fact.*
