*The characters in this story are fictitious.
Only the author is a real person. Being lazy he has chosen to
draw on current events for inspiration, instead of making it up
like real writers do.
The stuff about magic and meditation is established historical fact,
although it would never wash nowadays.*

For Fynn.
