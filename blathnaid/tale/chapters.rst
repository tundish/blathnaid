Morten
======

Once upon a time
----------------

Once upon a time not far from here, there was a young farm boy called Jack.

Jack
----

Jack's parents were elderly and sick. He had no brothers or sisters nor cousins nor aunts or uncles.

And the land they lived on was very poor.

This boy Jack had a plough horse, whose name was Morten. Every day they would go out together
to work a bit of good, whether it was clearing a ditch, or turning over some dirt, or mending a wall.

About Morten
------------

Now Morten had been a strong horse and very loyal, but he was getting on in years.

Likewise, the kit and the tools Jack had were all past their prime.
The bridles were mouldy, and the harrows were rusty, and the buckets came apart in your hand.

Clay
----

Also the ground, which was a horrible stodge of stone and clay, must have had some curse upon it.
It bent the plough, it clogged the bridges, it pulled every shoe from poor Morten's spongy old feet.

The Blacksmith
--------------

And so consequently Jack was a regular visitor to the local Blacksmith.

And one day, when Morten had shed a shoe, and Jack couldn't see where it had fallen,
he led his horse onto the narrow track and over to the Forge.

About Bláthnaid
---------------

Now the Blacksmith had a daughter, who was very pretty, and Jack's age. Her name was Bláthnaid. [*]_

.. [*] Bláthnaid is a name from the Gaeilge tradition. In England we would likely say *Blawnid*.

Chaste
------

[NARRATOR]_

    We aren't going to hear much about Bláthnaid just now though, because the Blacksmith keeps her hidden
    whenever Jack shows up. He worries that Bláthnaid, who sketches pictures of young men with their horses,
    might be thinking of Jack more often than is good for her.

    He has hopes she will marry into money, and doesn't want her going off with
    some young villain who can't pay his bills.

Open for business
-----------------

The front part of the Forge, where the anvil sat, was open on three sides.
There stood the Blacksmith, warming against the furnace. He had been watching Jack approach up the path,
and he could tell from Morten's stepping what the matter was about.

He took the end of rope from Jack's hand and steadied Morten for a moment.
Then he led the horse to a rail where he tied him up next to a butt of water.

About the Blacksmith
--------------------

[NARRATOR]_

    I should tell you a little more about the Blacksmith, but I don't want to hold up the rest of the story.
    I'll just say that he was a very wise man. He spoke easily with people, and he listened carefully to animals.
    He wasn't only a skilled Blacksmith, but also a clever Armourer, and a reliable Farrier.

Shoes
-----

The Blacksmith hated to see people sick, or animals hurt.
And so without a word he began to check on Morten; his eyes, his teeth, his belly.
And then to his hooves, whereupon he groaned quietly on seeing the state of each of them.

The Forge
---------

Jack knew he had no way to pay the Blacksmith, so he found it difficult to stand and watch him work.
Instead he wandered into the back of the Forge, where he was out of sight for a while.

Rafters
-------

[NARRATOR]_

    Twenty feet above his head, the roof is supported by a sturdy iron frame, from which a chain hoist dangles.
    From the dark corners of the eves, Jack can hear rustling and squeaking.

    In the middle of the workshop is the bottom half of a great casting mold.
    And there's all sorts of clutter piled up waiting for the next smelting; bags of bent and flaking nails,
    broken hasps and gears and levers. All damp and coated in bat droppings and bloom.

Send me the bill
----------------

Finally, when the horse was fully shod, the Blacksmith ducked back into where Jack had been standing.
"All's done", said the Smith, standing fully in the doorway.

"Dad thanks you", said Jack without much confidence.

"That's certain, Jack. And we must reckon up, presently. For today and for times past."

Broke
-----

[NARRATOR]_

    In those days you see, people would always help their neighbours whenever there was need.
    And should they get to owing too many favours they would settle up in coin at Yuletide.
    Jack is in a difficult spot because this year his family have very little to offer.
    The Blacksmith is chief among their creditors.
    So according to custom, Jack bows and he asks how he may be of service.

Errand
------

"I do have an errand you can do for me", says the Blacksmith.
"There is a message to deliver. It will be some days travelling."

Unprepared
----------

So Jack went home, and hunted around the little cottage for whatever might be useful on a journey.
He found so little food in the place that he dared not take any, for fear of leaving his parents in
want while he was away.

Packing
-------

He picked out a woollen blanket to sleep in, which he laid before the fire to drive off the damp.
He found a leather bottle, which he warmed up and replenished with wax.
He had some kindling, a blade, a flint, and a can with a lid so he could boil up water.

Morten would have to forage. And Jack would go hungry. But he was not dismayed.
He fell asleep before the grate, and dreamt of voyaging and adventure.

The Trivet
==========

Reporting for Duty
------------------

In the morning Jack rose early and bade goodbye to his parents. He went outside to unhitch Morten and strap on
his gear. On the way to the Forge they stopped by a little stream to fill up the bottle.

Lightly equipped
----------------

The Blacksmith was already waiting for them. He saw straight away how lightly equipped Jack was.

So he reached under the bench and pulled out a chunk of iron. Round in shape, it clanged and sang.
He looked at it thoughtfully for a moment, before taking a rough brush to scrub away the rust.

"You'll need that", said he, handing it to Jack.

About The Trivet
----------------

It was a Trivet, such as you'd use to sit a kettle on a fire.
This one was solidly made, but with a decorative design. It had curved spokes like the wheel of some
fantastic chariot. Around the circumference were embossed letters, not yet clear enough to read.

A token
-------

Then the Blacksmith opened a small tin box, taking from it a wrap of waxed paper and a metal tool,
like a saddler's punch.

Then he heated a small billet of iron, about the size of a pea pod, which had a hole in one end.

Activated
---------

[NARRATOR]_

    Peeling apart the paper, despite his grimy fingers, he carefully removes a small thin sheet of
    white metal foil. With the iron still hot, he deftly drops the metal foil upon the surface, and placing
    the punch on top, strikes it smartly with a hammer.

Issued
------

After it had cooled, the Blacksmith slipped a leather cord through the hole and placed it around the boy's neck.
Jack saw that within the metal there was stamped a circular seal of an intricate design, which by some strange
chemistry glowed a milky grey.

The Mission
-----------

The Blacksmith led Jack away from the building and on to the open road. "Jack, you are to go to the City", he said.
"Follow the road East. The charm I have given you will allow you in. But listen; the rise of the New Moon will
stop it shining. After that it is useless."

The Message
-----------

"When you get inside, seek out the Master of the Guild of Smiths.
The Guild sign looks very like this Trivet you carry.
He will know who sends you by the charm around your neck."

"Tell him this; that Bláthnaid is of age to marry. And now you must go."

They set off
------------

So Jack set off. The first few miles East were familiar to him, passing through places he had been before.
At the little hamlets on the way, he would look to catch the eye of anyone around, and wave and bid them good day.
He felt very proud and important to be on an errand to the City.

As the miles rolled on, and the day grew late, he started to notice a change in the country. The hedges were less
well kept than before. The ditches were choked and the signposts and milestones overgrown with weed.

In the evening he spied ahead a group of tents and carts.

Tinkers
-------

He guessed they might be tinkers, who move about wherever there is work. When he was younger they had
sometimes passed by, and his Mother had brought out the old tin bath for them to mend.

The camp
--------

The encampment was at the side of the road, and several people were tending fires or smoking pipes
or feeding donkeys.

Hungry
------

[NARRATOR]_

    Jack greets them every one, and some reply and some do not. They do not seem to be tinkers at all.
    There are many children, and some old folk. They are not very organised, and they all look tired,
    and cold, and hungry.

Brew up
-------

Of course, Jack had no food, and none was offered to him. So he built a little fire away from the main group, and
set up the Trivet, and boiled some water.

Boon
----

Now this Trivet was very special; only a few Blacksmiths know how to make such a thing.
Because whatever you brewed upon it, however little tea you had; in fact, no matter if you were only
boiling hay, that brew would nourish and cheer you throughout, and you would not feel the lack of a meal.

Camping
-------

So Jack rolled himself up in his blanket, near to the fire, warm and quite comfy.
Morten settled down under a tree, happy to be away from the plough, and very pleased with his new shoes.

Onward
------

They awoke in the grey of early dawn, and were soon on their way again.
As they went on, the road East got broader.
The villages they passed through were more frequent. The bigger they got, the more shabby they seemed to be.
The countryside around was ever more sad and bare, with less and less forage for Morten.

Yet onward
----------

[NARRATOR]_

    And so for three more days they travel. Jack can tell Morten is getting tired, and tries not to ride him.
    He leads him for miles at a time by the bridle. He pats his horse's flank, and worries about how skinny
    his ribs are becoming.

Optimism
--------

Jack had ceased to greet other travellers on the road, and preferred very much to camp alone.
As he lay looking up at the stars, he would take out the locket the Blacksmith had made for him, and marvel
at how it glowed in the darkness. The New Moon was yet two weeks away. Plenty of time to deliver a message,
thought Jack.

The City
========

Hinterland
----------

The last few miles were grim. There was not a tree or bush to be seen now; only a blasted and boggy heath.
The road was lined on both sides by ragged camps; turves piled up for walls, rooved with the remnants of
smashed-up wagons. And everywhere, the sounds and smells of sad and hungry people.

Blocked
-------

Up ahead the road was controlled by troops, who barred the way to the City and only opened the barricades at certain
times of day.

Challenged
----------

In his whole life, Jack had never stood in a line for anything, and the longer he waited the less sure of himself
he became. Finally, at the barrier, a sourfaced man in a leather tunic demanded to know what was his
business.

Jack could only hold up the locket and say, "I carry a message".
That seemed to suffice; the man lowered his truncheon and waved him through.

Through
-------

The walls of the City lay before them, and the road led up to an enormous gate.

Traffic
-------

[NARRATOR]_

    There is another line here. Scores of carts stand by, piled up with all kinds of goods.
    There are angry voices as traders argue with Guards and revenue men. Jack goes on past.
    He gathers his few belongings from Morten's back, and hoists them on his own.
    Then he aims for a smaller door next to the main entry which seems to be open to those on foot.

The Postern
-----------

The postern door was flanked by two Guards, sternly on duty. They held short, solid bills with evil-looking hooks
at the end.  One of the men stepped forward to take Morten's bridle.
The other offered the point of his weapon and advised Jack he should explain himself or go back where he came.

Password
--------

Jack repeated the words that had got him past the previous challenge. This time, the Guard studied the locket
carefully, before finally nodding. Then he asked, in a mocking way, whether the horse carried a message too,
and where was his token for entry?

Separated
---------

The first Guard tied poor Morten to a gatepost, saying, "if you can't feed him, you shouldn't keep him".
The second man scoffed, "sure, he'll eat very well presently!" There was nothing that Jack could do but
step through the gate while he was able, to the laughter of the Guards as he passed.

Inside
------

Inside the wall, Jack found himself on a raised buttress, with battlements on either side.
Two flights of steps led down to the street below.
He tripped and tumbled down them, confused and upset at how he had just lost Morten.

Ambush
------

[NARRATOR]_

    Several fellows are gathered by the stair. They take notice of him and Jack realises he had better
    recover his wits or else be robbed again. He hurries ahead until he gets to a spot where he can't be
    surprised. There he sinks to his haunches, steadies his breathing, and begins to look around.

Exploring
---------

In the streets near the gates of the City there were sheds and offices for the receipt of goods.
Further towards the centre was a large cobbled square, with taverns and boarding houses on every side.

Market
------

Set up at intervals were wooden market stalls. Many of them were shuttered or empty.
Long lines of people formed up at those who had stock.

Everywhere else was boarded up, or blocked off, or tumbled down.
Until you came to a gated arch near the Eastern wall.
Behind that was a high tower, barracks for the Guard, and the mansion of the Mayor.

Queues
------

[NARRATOR]_

    Wherever there is food for sale, there are Guards to keep order.
    The people look anxious and resentful. They pick each others pockets in the queues, and when they are
    discovered, they fall to arguing and fighting.
    Then in jump the Guards, and all run and scatter for fear of a cracked skull.

Environment
-----------

Jack sensed trouble. He was sure to be robbed; it seemed to be not merely a common occurrence, but the very
commerce of half the City. The second concern was getting lost, and while looking lost,
then to be cornered in some alley by thieves.

But only a few main streets of the City were open to all. Every neighbourhood,
where families were established, had set up gates and pickets, protecting their own, and permitting only
their own to pass through.

So Jack was able to trapse only a quarter of a mile back and forth, and quickly learned his way about the place.

Safety
------

[NARRATOR]_

    Everywhere you look there are notices. They are pasted on walls and pinned to the street posts.

    They all bear the image of Mayor Ingomer.
    He is pictured heroically in a woodcut which is now several years old.

    Ingomer is reminding everyone to Stay Safe. By that he means not lighting fires.
    Staying Safe is also very much about handing in all your long knives,
    and remaining at home even if you don't have any food.

Scarcity
--------

Ingomer controlled the supply of food into the City. It was in his name that the guards stopped the wagons at the gate.
They diverted the best goods to his favoured merchants, and shook down the hauliers for cash.

Numbers
-------

The Mayor also ran a system of licences which meant you had to apply for permission to light a brazier.

And that's how Jack found the Smiths, down at the dock by the river.
They'd all built their workshops on the same wharf, having had to pool together to pay
the fees for running their Forges.

Checks
------

Many times Jack was stopped and asked to explain who he was. Luckily the locket did the trick.
Whatever it stood for, the Guards evidently knew it, though Jack himself was none the wiser.

Krol
====

A refuge
--------

While exploring one of the squares, Jack found himself gazing at a grand-looking Tavern, three storeys high.
He watched as two draymen brought in barrels for the cellar.
And he saw that every time one half of those big cellar doors banged shut, the hasp on it shook a little loose.
Now when the draymen left, they were careful to place a padlock on the door. But they couldn't seem to fasten it
properly, and after a minute or two, they gave up and left it dangling.

So Jack waited until there was a commotion further up the street, and all heads were turned. Then he went over to
the doors and was able to work one bolt out of its seat, lift up one half of the hatchway, and slip inside.

The cellar
----------

Down below in the cellar it was not fully dark. Some light streamed in by gratings which gave sight of the street above.
Jack saw that the place was lined and vaulted in brick. It was all one room about ten feet high which got lower and
darker towards the back.

A Vacancy
---------

But he saw that as you went further inside, it got dusty, which made him think no one troubled to go there. And by
hopping over the floor into the shadows, he found a spot where he was sure he could sleep without being seen, even if
someone came in for some reason.

Tuns
----

Now down in the cellar were many barrels all stacked up. But three stood separately on their side, and they were enormous.
Each with a tap, and a dish below to catch the drips.
And on the first barrel was painted **This**, and on the second **That**, and on the last one, **The Other**.

Upstairs
--------

They stood near some steps which quickly ended in a locked door, and nothing Jack could do could open that.
But he went to work on the main cellar hatch, and contrived with his knife to make sure that the bolt would allow him in and
out, notwithstanding any padlock above.

Get some kip
------------

Then, weary from all that had transpired, he rolled himself up in his blanket for the night, hidden in the shadows.

Awoken
------

Jack awoke on the stroke of midnight. He first thought he'd been roused by a clock bell, but he immediately felt very
much as though he was not alone in the cellar.

About Krol
----------

And sure enough, squatting in a pool of moonlight in front of him was a strange little figure. He looked like an old
man, skinny, and only about three feet high. He wore no clothes and had no hair, except for a few wisps on his chin. He
sat with legs half-crossed, as a prisoner might in a cell with no furniture.

The name of this creature was Krol.

The legend
----------

[NARRATOR]_

    I am not the world expert on Krol.  What I have heard about him would fill a book,
    although only half of it is likely true.

    I do know he's been an important figure in Antiquity. He appears again as a man in our modern age, and
    does do many brave deeds here.

    But at the time of this story he is held back in the Netherworld. For reasons I don't understand, his spirit
    is bound to the City, and the best he can manage is to manifest in the cellar of that Tavern, when the moon
    is full enough to shine through the bars of the windows.

Try This
--------

So Krol said, "I am cursed to be here while there is light from the Moon. And I may eat only what is offered to me".
Jack thought about this for a moment and went over to one of the big barrels, which was called **This**.
He opened up the tap a little, so it half-filled the tundish below.
And he passed it to the little Imp, who grinned and straight away started drinking it down.

Simplicity
----------

Then Krol caught sight of Jack's Trivet and thoughtfully traced the shape of one spoke with a thin bony finger.
"Do you know what this one is?", he asked.

Jack couldn't fathom what he meant.

"This spoke stands for **Simplicity**", said Krol. He continued, sounding slightly tipsy.
"Simplicity. Try to train that. It can be cultivated, can simplicity."
Jack was about to ask him to repeat himself, but when he looked he saw that Krol had fallen immediately to sleep.

The Smiths
----------

Jack awoke next morning to find he was alone again. He gathered his things and stole out from the cellar into the street.
He went over to the place by the dock where the Smiths worked.
He tried to think of a way to befriend them, and so he gathered up some scraps of bark which lay around the
woodstore nearby.

Jack went politely up to one of them and asked if he might heat up his little kettle on their embers.
The Smiths all needed cheering up, so they welcomed him to share a brew from his Trivet.

Fell
====

The Friend
----------

One of the Blacksmiths, a man named Fell, took an interest in the Trivet.
He fancied he knew who might have made it. So he asked Jack if he could take a closer look.
But Jack was reluctant; all the time in the City he feared being robbed or tricked somehow.

Courage
-------

So Fell said, "I'll wager there is a motto around the edge of that article you have.
Do you know what it is?" Jack did not, but he held up the Trivet in both hands for the Smith to see.
"Ah", says the Smith, "I recognize that one word. It is **Courage**".
He would have liked to study the rest of the lettering, but Jack dared not risk any loss, and he hid the
Trivet again in his bundle.

In the old days
---------------

Jack asked who was the Master of the Guild, but Fell shook his head.
He began to tell him of the old days, when Smiths had such skill it would be thought magical today.
And how Ingomer, brother-in-law to the General of the Guards, on becoming Mayor, had brought in new rules.

Locksmiths
----------

First he'd created a licence for making locks, which the Smiths had to purchase from him at great cost.
Meanwhile, with the proceeds Ingomer was setting up his own Guild of Locksmiths, to whom he granted
permission instead.

"But the thing is", said Fell, "they can't seem to maintain their tolerances."

"For sure, there is not one key in this City that will match another. And don't drop one of their padlocks.
The tumblers jam up if you do".

First wish gone
---------------

And that was all that Fell would say, and he turned back to his work. So Jack wandered around for a while
and went back to the cellar to sleep.

Hiding
------

During the night, the inner door of the cellar would frequently open and someone from the Tavern above would
come down to fetch a cask back upstairs.
Jack never saw who it was because he took care always to be far back in the shadows.

He had also to remember not to leave tracks in the dust or to tear down any cobwebs lest he be discovered.
So when he was not rolled up in his blanket he was standing motionless, sometimes for hours.

Standing
--------

[NARRATOR]_

    Now this can be a very good thing to do, although not many people know the secret.
    For the first few minutes, you can't stop your mind from wandering,
    but then slowly you start to breathe with your belly, and your shoulders open up,
    and your hips find their shape again.
    Everything sinks through your legs into the ground, and then all things become possible.

Compassion
----------

As soon as Jack awoke, he would be out again to learn more from the Smiths.
Fell remained interested in the Trivet, and Jack allowed him to inspect the strange markings on the edge.
They had been worn down by use, but after a little time cleaning, Fell started to understand another word.
"This one says **Compassion**", he said.

Boilermakers
------------

Then Fell resumed his account of Mayor Ingomer.  How, after some sudden accident which no one could explain, Ingomer
set up an inspectorate for pressure vessels, whose punishing fees nearly put the Smiths entirely out of business.
Luckily, the new Guild of Boilermakers, of which Ingomer was Director, was soon in place to take on the burden of both
manufacture and assurance of all such things in the City.

But according to Fell, the Boilermakers still had a lot to learn when it came to metallurgy.
They were diligent in the proving of their seams, yet they had no care at all that the flux was contaminating the Gin.

Second wish gone
----------------

And that was all that Fell would say, and he went back to his work.
So Jack dangled his legs over the dock for a bit, then went back to the cellar to sleep.

Try That
--------

At midnight in the cellar, up popped Krol.
Jack was pleased to see him, and went over to the second barrel, upon which
was painted **That**. Jack opened the tap until the tundish was half to the brim and he passed it into the beam of
moonlight which held the ghostly shape.

Sensitivity
-----------

Krol needed no second invitation, and drank the beer gratefully. Then he set the dish down again, and went back to
the Trivet, which was there on the floor. And he indicated one of the spokes and said,
"Do you know what this one is?", and of course Jack did not.
"This one stands for **Sensitivity**", said Krol.
He paused for a moment, trying not to stumble over his words.
"Sensitivity. Try to train that. It can be cultivated, can sensitivity."

And before Jack could get him to explain any more, Krol had curled up and was off to sleep.

Longevity
---------

[NARRATOR]_

    But Jack can't sleep. He feels very alone, in a very strange world. So he stands there in his little spot
    in the dark. And he calms his breathing, until it moves down from his chest into his belly.
    Breathing slower, and softer. Until nearly half a minute to breathe in, and nearly half a minute to
    breathe out.

Cognition
---------

The next morning Jack felt he urgently needed to find the Master of Smiths, so he was out again early to see his friend Fell.

He in his turn had been eager to check the Trivet and its third set of markings. After applying
some paste, and rubbing with a cloth, he could make out its meaning. "This one reads **Cognition**", he declared.

Cutlers
-------

Then Fell took up his story of Ingomer.
Recently he'd forbidden the Smiths from forging blades or any edged tools, and arranged for his own
Guild of Cutlers to be licensed exclusively for those items. Their factories were in a protected area near the Armoury.

Fell had nothing but contempt for the Cutlers. He said they were all blade and no tang.
They did not understand the process of designing a product.
So when the Guards were issued new glaives,
they preferred to take off the head in order that they could beat people with the handle.
It was significantly safer for the operator.

Third wish gone
---------------

And that was all that Fell would say, and he went back to his work. So Jack wandered over to where two groups of youths
were fighting over a basket of cabbages. When the Guards arrived he headed off to the cellar for the evening.

Try the Other
-------------

And there was Krol again, but looking mopey this evening. Straight away he said to Jack, "Tomorrow comes a crescent moon.
And so all my time is done."

And Jack looked down at his locket which was beginning to fade, and he knew that he hadn't long to carry out his
task in the City. And so he went over to **The Other**, and poured out a draft into the dish.
Krol took it, and nodded his thanks before knocking it back.

Spontaneity
-----------

Krol reached out for the Trivet, and he held it up in the faint pool of moonlight so Jack could see. He laid his
finger on the third spoke, and said, "This is **Spontaneity**."
He raised his finger in the air dramatically, and wagged it at Jack.
"Try to train that. It can be cultivated, can spontaneity."

There was a clatter as the Trivet fell to the floor and rolled back against Jack's foot. Krol had fallen asleep.

Sinking
-------

[NARRATOR]_

    Jack is too anxious to sleep. He keeps standing there in the dark, letting his shoulders go forward a little,
    until the tension in his neck drops out, and he hears the bones in his back letting go of each other.
    Then in lumps it falls into his legs, and runs like hot sweat down the inside of his skin.

The Master
----------

First thing next morning, Jack ran over to see Fell, and begged him to reveal who was Master of the Guild.
So Fell explained.

Advancement
-----------

In the same way that rich merchants introduce their daughters to Court, hoping them to marry into
the nobility; so likewise the artisans would raise their girls to set their sights on the son of a merchant.
The families relied on their seniors to make the connections, and so it had become the tradition to announce
one's offspring to the head of one's Guild, and they would go and make enquiries as to a suitable match.

Ostracised
----------

But Ingomer declared that there was to be no more marrying to the advantage of Smiths.
Instead, any young girls of a Blacksmith family would be sent to work in the Temple.

Suspicion
---------

No one really knew what went on the Temple, but the less they knew, the more they could guess.  From then on, the Smiths
started to leave the City. The ones who could not flee, organised themselves, and there was rioting.  But Ingomer called
an emergency, and the unrest was put down by the Guards.

Insurrection
------------

After that there was a hasty election, for which some parties were very well prepared.
At the end of it Ingomer had become Master of the Guild of Smiths,
a position which hitherto had been attained only by the most skilled and respected of craftsmen.

Ingomer
=======

So it's Ingomer
---------------

It was the eve of the New Moon. Jack was at the gated arch in the East of the City.

Trumpets called out, the gates swung open and through it came the Mayoral parade.
And there on an armoured carriage was Ingomer, in all his robes and finery, surrounded by Guards.

Last time for the Locket
------------------------

Jack stepped forward and raised up his locket saying, "I carry a message!"

Ingomer always kept his ears open for news, and he raised his hand to halt the procession.
He glanced at the locket, and then back at Jack. "What is it? Quickly!"

He looked older than the portrait on his notices, and altogether less noble.
Ingomer hadn't been feeling well lately. His weakness for Gin had paled his skin.
Where he had tried to shave, his face was sore and blotchy.

Here's my Message
-----------------

The parade fell silent, and it seemed to Jack that the whole world had hushed too.
He opened his mouth again. There was no effort to be made. The words came from a deep place of their own.

"Bláthnaid is of age to marry."

Ingomer's reaction
------------------

The effect this had on Ingomer was a shock to all around him.
He recognised the name, you see. It was one of the peasant names that Blacksmiths gave their daughters.

It had been ten years since he'd brought servitude and violation to the children
of his enemies. But they had escaped him, and found ways to prosper, and now saw fit to mock him.

Ingomer shook with rage. "Progeniem Vitiosiorem!", he cursed, in the secret language of the Temple.

Alongside his anger, there was fear in him too. "Progeniem Vitiosiorem!", he bellowed again.

He felt very old now.

"Progeniem Vitiosiorem!"

Kicked out
----------

Bodyguards rushed forward and grabbed Jack, and two of them pushed through the crowd in advance
of their captive. They carried him as far as the next street corner, threw him down, and beat him.

But Jack wasn't too much hurt, nor did the Guards really try to arrest him.
They assumed him to be one of Ingomer's spies, albeit now out of favour for having delivered bad news.

Chase is on
-----------

By the time the Captain of Guard had rung the general alarm, Jack was already on his feet and he took
off, dodging through the crowd until it thinned out, and then he sprinted away.

Some of the Guards made after him though. Three or four were just back from the war;
freshly assigned to parade detail. They hadn't yet had time to adjust to the Cutlers' shiny new armour.
The injuries they sustained from their equipment as they ran were later to be the subject of an inquiry.

Jack was careful to shake them off before he stopped for breath, and then took an obscure route to get
back to his hiding place under the Tavern.

Options
-------

That night, back in the cellar, Jack had no idea what to do next. He wondered if he should stay in the
City, and ask Fell to teach him Smithing. For how could he try to go home with no horse and no way to
make a living? He had delivered the message, after a fashion. He could even recall the reply. Ingomer's
odd words had somehow lodged themselves in Jack's brain.

Dissolving
----------

[NARRATOR]_

    He stands all night. He takes in heaven at the crown of his head, and passes it down into the earth.
    Then he draws it up until he is filled again, and with it he waters the dark abyss.

Time's up
---------

In the morning, Jack looked down at his locket.
But the locket shone no longer. And he knew he had to go.

Evasion
-------

[NARRATOR]_

    Patrols in the streets, in pairs, and Jack has no permit to pass.

    Therefore he creeps behind so close as to tap them on the forehead.
    His breath steady, his step light, and they do not perceive him.
    He borrows their badge; so must thieves stand aside, daring not to delay him.

    Or he takes up dancing; he spins with arms oddly up and aloft, until beggars laugh to throw him their
    pennies.

    They show him their backs, those Guards, in disgust, and he hurries along to the gateway.

Escape
------

Outside the City walls again, Jack threaded his way past the bullying Guards and the chiselling merchants.  He headed
West, now gladly on the road home.

Evacuation
----------

The first thing he noticed was how crowded the way was; he saw that many more people were trying to get to the City.
All hungry, all cold, and all seeking shelter. On the far side of the first barricade, more settlements had sprung up,
filled with people who had not been allowed through.

With Courage
------------

Many were distressed, especially those with young children.  And wherever he could he taught them how to find Courage;
which comes spontaneously, unbidden, and is simple in its expression.

Legging it
----------

He tramped on for two more days and nights, at a steady pace, trying not to tire himself.

With Cognition
--------------

Some people, when they saw that Jack was going the other way, would stop him to ask him what was the news.
And he would advise them on Cognition; how to figure things out. How to be sensitive to the Universe in all
its music and how to perceive the simple processes at play.

Roughing it
-----------

All the time the weather was turning for the worse, and Jack was starting to suffer from sleeping in the open.

With Compassion
---------------

So he began to knock at the farms and cottages and offer to tell tales of the City. And when the people opened their
doors he would talk with them about Compassion; how human sensitivity is manifest spontaneously and authentically.

Bláthnaid
=========

Payback
-------

A fortnight after escaping the City, Jack stood once again at the Forge.

"Did you meet with the Master?" asked the Blacksmith.

"Yes, I did", said Jack.

"And what did he say?"

The long version
----------------

Jack had on his mind to explain the full story, but as soon as he opened his mouth to do so,
the words of Ingomer announced themselves unbidden.

The short version
-----------------

"Progeniem Vitiosiorem!"

Curse
-----

[NARRATOR]_

    The faint squeaking in the roof of the Smithy gives way to silence.
    The bats, who have been listening, fall to grave contemplation.
    There is a change in the mood.

Karma
-----

From the space in the roof they burst out in their thousands.
In a blur of fur and leather they ascended in a column like smoke from a hot chimney.

The bats beat their wings, and they raised up an evil cloud of dust and metal.
This haze rose up until the sun itself burned white and fierce like a gas mantle.

When the very last creature had got out of the Smithy, they swarmed in the air for a moment.
Then they headed East.

The Blacksmith turned his head to follow them.

"They carry a message", he said.
